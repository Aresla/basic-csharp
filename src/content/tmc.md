## Doing the exercises

You can find the exercises for each part at the end of each chapter. In some chapters, there might be no exercises.

You can follow these instructions (to a point) on how to submit exercises: 
[https://www.mooc.fi/en/installation/vscode/#first-programming-exercise](https://www.mooc.fi/en/installation/vscode/#first-programming-exercise)

<Note>
At this point, you might encounter a bug, and the exercises do not show up.

In this case, you have to choose again the Extensions menu, select the TMC extension, and enable it.

After enabling, VSCode will ask if you trust the extension and the files, say YES to both questions.
</Note>


## Running the exercises

<Note>
The part of "Running the source code" does not unfortunately work yet.

We have to run our exercises manually, if we want to do so.
</Note>

### Short way

In Visual Studio Code,
* Click on the file `Program.cs` with **right mouse button**, and choose `Open in integrated terminal`.
* Run the program by writing the command `dotnet run` in to the newly opened terminal, and press `Enter`.

### The longer way

In Visual Studio Code, select `Terminal` and then `New Terminal`

![Terminal menu](https://github.com/centria/basic-csharp/raw/master/src/images/new-terminal.png)

A selection of options will pop up. The selections contain all the open exercises. In the example, I am doing part 6, so I have those open.

![Folder selection](https://github.com/centria/basic-csharp/raw/master/src/images/select-folder.png)

* Select the exercise you are doing
* A new terminal opens at the bottom of Visual Studio Code.

* write the command `cd src/Exercise000` , but instead of the zeros, use the actual exercise number. Press `Enter`.

![Selecting source folder](https://github.com/centria/basic-csharp/raw/master/src/images/exercise003.png)

* In the example, I am doing exercise 003 of the part, so my command is `cd src/Exercise003`
* Now you are in the actual exercise folder, and can run the program.
* Run the program with the command `dotnet run`. 

![Dotnet run](https://github.com/centria/basic-csharp/raw/master/src/images/dotnet-run.png)

* If your program works as it should, you can see the output in the console. The next example is from Part 6, exercise 003:

<Note>The dollar sign in the pictures is NOT part of the command! </Note>
