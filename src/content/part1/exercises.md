<Exercise title={'001 Hello World'}>
The basic structure of a program is given in the exercise:

```cs
using System;

namespace Exercise001
{
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Add your code here:
            
        }
    }
}
```

The line **// Add your code here:** is a comment. The composer does not compose it, so you do not have to worry about it. You can remove it, if you want.

Create a program that writes the text **Hello World!** into the console. The program contains the basic structure pictured above.

Dummy text between tags.

  class Program
  {

      {
       string name = "Ada Lovelace";
       // Write your code here:
       }
  }
}
```

This is not a coding exorcist.
